# sd-troll

An ambitious project to troll people in my colab at April Fools

What does it do?
- A chance to generate Rick Roll
- A chance to generate Hatsune Miku
- A chance to flip the generated images upside down
- Fake Discord pings
- Hotkey to disable the troll (ctrl+I) and (ctrl+L)
- 70% chance of redirecting users to rickroll or troll song when trying to toggle the troll
